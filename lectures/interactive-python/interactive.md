## Motivation

Python is a high level general purpose programming language.

It also has an interactive interface, circumventing 
the need to create larger formal coding structures, 
and compiling.

# Python Shell

The Python shell is the simplest way to access the Language.

However, it is only suitable for the shortest excursions.
