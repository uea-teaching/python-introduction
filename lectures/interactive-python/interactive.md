## Motivation

Python is a high level general purpose programming language.

It also has an interactive interface, circumventing 
the need to create larger formal coding structures, 
and compiling.

---

# Python Shell

--

The Python shell is the simplest way to access the Language.

However, it is only suitable for the shortest excursions.

--

in your shell, type `python`

![py-shell-start](../assets/img/py-shell-start.png)

--

to get back to your prompt, type `exit()` or `quit()`

![py-shell-exit](../assets/img/py-shell-exit.png)

Note: you can also use the key press ctrl d or ctrl z

--

help is available in interactive mode...

![py-shell-help](../assets/img/py-shell-help.png)

Note: To exit help, type q for "quit" and then hit the enter key. 
You will be taken back to the Python shell

--

you can type simple expressions...

Note: check out the big integers in python!!

--

secondary prompt for continuation lines...

Note: you can use tab to indent, and return moves to next line...
