# Tuple

A tuple is a collection which is 
<span style="color:coral">**ordered**</span> and
<span style="color:coral">**immutable**</span>.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

![pronouncing](../assets/tuhple-toople.jpg)

--

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuples are written with parentheses (round brackets).
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

```python
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values

--

We access tuple items by indexing
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```python
mytuple[0]
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```text
apple
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
We will dive deeper into indexing with `lists`
