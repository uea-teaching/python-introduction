# Introduction to Programming with Python

This module introduces the programming language Python, for students with little 
or no previous programming experience.


## Lectures

The material is presented as a series of lectures.
I will make the slides available online *and* I will try to keep this material low-bandwidth.


### Functions in Python

The first [lecture](https://uea-teaching.github.io/python-introduction/lectures/lecture1/) 
covers Functions in Python.



## Requirements

This course covers the Python programming language. 
Regardless of the platform you are working on, Python is available.

The only requirement to view the slides is a web browser. 
For very low bandwidth users, you can view the raw text files for each lecture
by navigating [here](https://github.com/uea-teaching/python-introduction/tree/gh-pages).
